# Chasing-Game-PurpleVSGreen
Week Assignment for AI For Games course

# #AboutTheProject
This project was made during one-two days as a week assignemnt for the Artificial Intelligence For Games course at Tallinn University.

The project's primary focus is to create a sample chasing game.

The important keys are

## 1. Spawn and set the players moving.

## 2. Purple players chase green players and catch them if they reach them = come within 0.5 m of them.

## 3. Caught green players are escorted by the purple player to the gaol. When the green player has been deposited, the purple player starts chasing again.

## 4. Players cannot pass through the fence. Do not use Unity colliders to achieve this.

## 5. Detect if either team has won.

# #AboutAssets

All assets (graphics, sound, and music) are downloaded free from the websites providing free assets. One of the music is originally made by me.

# #FurtherContributionsAndCurrentBugs
- Add acceleration and deceleration to the motion of the players.
- Add leading to the behaviour of chasing purple players, so that they aim for the future position of the green player.
- Add random velocity changes to chased green players.
- Add a tiredness factor, so that players cannot run at full speed longer than a time tstaminai, individual to each player. After that they have to rest for a time tresti.
- Add better bodies to the players.

# #RunTheGame
A build still needs to be created.
Feel free to run the project Unity.
